Nitty gritty of this License!

1. The Regular License grants you, the purchaser an ongoing, non-exclusive, worldwide license to make use of the digital work (Item) you have selected.
2. You are licensed to use the Item to create one single End Product for yourself or for one client (a “single application”), and the End Product may be Sold to one End User.
3. If you or your client want to Sell or Reskin the End Product, you will need the Extended License. Extended License Permits selling & reskinning of the End Product for up to 10 clients.
4. An End Product is one of the following things, both requiring an application of skill and effort.

(a)For an Item that is a template, the End Product is a customised implementation of the Item.

For example: the item is an App UI Kit template and the end product is the full App customised with your content.

(b) For other types of Item, an End Product is a work that incorporates the Item as well as other things, so that it is larger in scope and different in nature than the Item.

For example: the item is a Video calling plugin and the end product is an Online Video Consultation App.

Own a great opportunity! What else can you do with your purchased Item? 4. You can create one End Product for a client, and you can transfer that single End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client.

5. You can make any number of copies of the single End Product, as long as the End Product is distributed for Free.

6. You can modify, transform or manipulate the element of the Item or the whole Item itself. You can combine the Item with other works and make a derivative work from it. The resulting works are subject to the terms of this license. You are only permitted to do these things as long as the End Product you then create meets the criteria set forth in Point Number 4.

Things you are strictly prohibited to do with the Item:

7. You cannot Sell the End Product, except to one client if you have purchased the Regular License for the Product.

8. You cannot sell the End Product exceeding the number 10 even if Extended License is purchased.

9. You cannot resell the Item as stock, in a tool or template, or with Source Code files. You cannot do this with an Item either on its own or in a combination with other items even if you alter the Item. You cannot re-distribute or make available the Item as-is or with superficial modifications. These things are not allowed even if the re-distribution is for Free.

10. You cannot use the Item in any application that allows an end-user to customize a digital or physical product to their specific needs. You can use the Item in this way only if you purchase a separate license of the Item for each final product that is created using the application.

For example: Drag & Drop App builder offers “create your own” calling Apps or blogging App. You'll need one license for each user product.

11. Although you can modify the Item and thereby remove unwanted components before creating the single End Product, you cannot extract and use a single component of an Item on a stand-alone basis.

For example: You license a Mobile Application containing blogging section, Course Selling section, Video Uploading section, etc. You can delete unwanted features from the Source Code. But you cannot extract any on these features to use outside of the product neither for commercial purpose nor for free re-distribution.

12. You must not permit an end user of the End Product to extract the Item and use it independently from the End Product.

13. You are not permitted to use an Item in a logo, trademark, or service mark.

14. A portion in the Item that may be sourced from somewhere else and the component may be subject to the License terms of that Source or the open source. In this case, we may specify the part in the downloaded files. The source license terms will apply to that component. Our License will be applied to the remaining of the Item.

For example: The icons in the app used for the representation purpose may subject to the Source License Terms.

15. You are only allowed to use the Item for lawful purposes. Also, if an Item contains an image of an individual, even if the Item is just for model-released you cannot use it in a way that creates a false identity, implies personal endorsement of a product by the individual, or in a way that is defamatory, obscene or demeaning, or in connection with sensitive subjects.

16. If you breach this license, it will be terminated. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from your Platform.

17. We, the creator of the Item retains ownership of the Item but grant you the license on these terms. This license is between you (Purchased End Product User) and us (Thinkcreative Technologies).
